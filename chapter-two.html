        Usability testing is testing, in which test participants test product or we can say web site. To check the quality of a website is good or not. If we define testing as qualitative or quantitative then ‘Do it yourself' usability tests definitely come under qualitative. There are a lot of advantages with this is, ‘do it yourself' tests can be informal and it should not be scientific. A tester can decide protocol test by him/herself, the main advantage is here is, a tester can change the testing protocol in mid of the testing.  This kind of tests always works because every site will always have some problems and normal these problems can be found only by using, not do much research. This kind of testing helps us to design better. But because in website development companies always have tight schedules, so it is very used testing in companies, even though is very valuable.

         Do-it-yourself is not difficult to conduct and it's not much expensive also. A 'Big Honkin' test is used by large organizations, but the do-it-yourself test is very reasonable, so whether its large organization or a smaller one, anyone can use this without much spending big amount. There are a lot of differences between Big Honkin' test and DO-it-yourself test, like in Big Hokin' test need   1-2 days of tests then a week to brief, then decide what to fix and it can be conducted 1-2 times only when  site will be nearly completed .in this test we need to recruit tester specifically as per project. On another hand Do-it-yourself test only takes a half day to test, brief and decide what to fix, it normally conducts every month and its not necessary to recruit specifically, anyone can test. because all of this do-it-yourself can be more valuable for companies.</p>

         It always a good way if testing is testing from beginning itself. If you are going to start testing when your project is in its last stage then there you might face those problems, which cannot be fixed . because of some common reasons people usually skip testing at its early stage. But we should start testing from the first stage where you can test your own site or your competitor's site, so can you find the problem from yours and other's past. You even can take advice for your rough designs, so you can change it before wasting time on development of a wrong design. Testing wireframe of web pages and testing of its working prototypes is very important in earlier stages.</p><hr>

         Its very important part of the testing is, that whom you are recruiting for testing. Recruit someone, then schedule their appointments and getting them to show up on the test day can be difficult if we will not plan this properly. So first thing what kind of people we should hire? The answer is we can hire anyone, even though a person is not our target audience because some they find problems that normal user won't face. In this type of testing three testers are best. We can find perfect recruit for us as per our website domain or we can hire someone to recruit tester for us. We have check go with a plan and kept contact with everyone so everyone can show up on test day. Last thing we have to compensate everyone on test day, whether its observer or its tester.</p><hr>

         <h1>Chapter-6</h1>
         
         Important thing before testing that you should have clarity what tester will be going to test. So there are two things you should decide first what is a task they will do ? and these tasks comes under which scenarios. To start with this, first, write a list of 5-10 task. These tasks can be those which will test critical part of project or the part which will be going to give trouble or anything. After this, you have to make scenarios, so tester can test it, scenarios should be clear, unambiguous and easy to understand. Try to come up with restrictions also, so people can test as you want .last thing before testing, you should try a pilot test, so you can check that scenarios that you are giving are working.</p><hr>

         <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
 
         Checklists are kind of boring but it's important to remember what has to be done when.While doing a usability test there are lots of things we have to remember so checklist helps
         So make checklists of tasks like before and after usability test what u have to do.

         Example:-

         Three weeks before
        • Figure out what you are going to be testing.
        • Advertise for participants.
        • Book a test room
        • Book an observation room of similar size far from test room with all the setup.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>

          The role of a facilitator is mentioned below:-
          1.  He has to guide the users like a tour guide what they have to do without giving them much pressure.Let them analyze how they should have to use the website.
         2.  Your job is to make them comfortable and encourage them at every point to think loud and express their feelings of thoughts.
         To do this usability test we have to set a test room properly with proper equipment such as:
         • A computer with internet
         • Screen sharing software 
         • Screen recording software
         • USB Microphone
         • Monitor and keyboard
         • A plain vanilla mouse
         • speakerphone

         All these things should be easy to use by the user.Before starting the test keep everything ready according to the user.Make a nice contact with the user throughout the test and especially before starting the exam.After the test examines everything by asking questions.</p><hr>

       <p id="ninth">
       <h1>Chapter 9</h1>

      The main benefit we get from usability testing is when we do it in person.We get to know more the users in person how they think, how they react to site. Seeing the video clips later doesn't give you that much clarity.
      The more different kind of people will participate more different advice you will get.So encourage everyone to attend the usability test. Do advertisements and make more clear to them what it is.
 
      While observing the usability test many things has to be taken care of:-
 
       1.  We should take notes of anything different and interesting we notice especially where the users are stuck and confused.
       2.  List down all important things you notice after each session.
       3.  Then compare all the notes which are important and has to fix first.
       4.  Don’t disturb the session in between and write down all the questions to ask at the end.</p><hr>

       
       <p id="tenth">
       <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
       After doing the usability test it’s time to debriefing everything.So we need two things:
       • Notes and a list of most serious usability problems faced by a user.
       • List of problems going to fix first in the next month.
       Worst problems have to be taken care first. Sometimes easy problems take priority because we have resources to fix and then worst problems will leave behind which can affect the image of the website to focus more on worst problems.

       To have a smooth debriefing meeting list down all the tasks given to users and their performances.Observe again how they have approach to eac tasks.Mistakes or problems faced by many users are the worst problems so list it down and listen to everyone’s opinion and summarize the whole test and its outcome in an email.</p><hr>

       <p id="eleven">
       <h1>Chapter 11</h1>

       Fixing the usability problems is a great challenge.Obviously, we don't have enough time to permanently fix all the problems because the market is waiting for our product. In such a case a quick fix is better than a permanent fix. As the fewer user will experience the problems and it will be easy to implement and in less time and cost.
       Sometimes fixing some usability problems leads to redesign the whole website which again needs more usability tests.So tweak is the better option than the redesign. It requires less effort and small changes. If we redesign it increases the rate of risks and complexities.</p><hr>

       <p id="twelve">
       <h1>Chapter 12</h1>

      Getting same usability problem, again and again, is kind of boring but in reality, it is good for the website at least we will have a clear idea of the common problem.
      Most of the time user get distracted from their path that is fine but when the home page is not able to help them and guide them that is a big problem. Design your homepage in such a way so that if a user is lost they can again come in the right direction through the homepage.Don't make your homepage overcrowded.The things you want people should notice on your website should be highlighted properly.The way designers look the website and users do is totally different so think in that angle.</p><hr>


      <p id="thirteen">
      <h1>Chapter 13</h1>

       At the time of fixing usability problems a lot of problems arise in order to fix them.
       1.  Designers start putting things off because fixing problems leads to arising more problems and more effort.So they just give a solution to wait for the next design to come.
       2.  Sometimes stakeholders and team members don’t get chance to give advice what to fix so they just drag themselves out.  
       3.  Sometimes a change of management and direction also affects.
       4.  Some problems have deep roots which lead to whole design change which they can't take a risk at that time.

       In usability process management has to spend money sometimes they agree and sometimes not.So in this designer should have their code or content ready so that management don't need to spend more cost in fixing problems.</p><hr>

       <h1>Chapter 14</h1>

       Remote testing is a good option sometimes instead of bringing the users you go to them electronically.Getting users is little difficult but in this users participate more as it is easy to schedule, no traveling.The outcomes are almost same as meeting users in person.

         But we shouldn’t do all the tests by remote testing.Because some disadvantages are also there:

         1.  It will be hard to understand what user thinks if he doesn't express all his thoughts aloud.
         2.  Sometimes body language tells a lot instead of speech that we can experience only in person.
         3.  More time has to spend just to clarifying what user said and meant.
         4.  And it's harder to be in touch continuously due to network connectivity issues or breaks taken by the user for some reason.

         If communication goes well in remote testing so there is a lot of chance of getting same results as of testing in person. All the setup should be ready and tested before starting the session.</p><hr>
