          <h1><u>Chapter 1</u> "Krug's First Law of Usability"</h1>
           <br>
            Usability of any website increases if more users use it. In this world, we have a lot of different people with different state of minds and thinking capability. Our aim is to reach all the levels of thinking capabilities with our website. So, the most important thing to keep in mind is to make the website easy to understand (what it is) and self-explanatory (how it works). 
            <br>
            We should not let people think too much. If someone looks at your website for the first time he /she should be able to find out all the actions related to his/her work without thinking. If he thinks and takes time to get what he wants means that your website is not easy to understand. More questions lead to more difficulty for the user. Our aim is to get rid of all the questions.
            <br>
            Use familiar and catchy words so that user can relate to real world. Every component should explain it’s work from its design (For example, what is a <a>link</a> and what is <button>clickable</button>).
            Let’s take all the thinking load from the user. To do that think like an average user.
            <br>
            People don’t like to be puzzled. Much thinking and doing effort for small actions can lead the users to switch to another site. So, make the website more self-evident and less self-explanatory.

           <h1><u>Chapter 2</u> "How We Really Use The Web"</h1><br>

            How we think as a designer and how the user thinks while using website is totally different.
            We make the website keeping in mind that let the user read all the things what we are offering but in reality,  the user just scan it and the moment they find their interest they click on it and finish their work.<br>

            For designing effective web pages keep in mind how the web is used in real time.<br>

            1.  People don’t read pages because they are always in hurry, they don’t think they need to read everything and by only scanning, they can reach their interesting goals. <br>
            2.  People don’t make optimal choices as normally they don’t think much before clicking anything, so they want more chances to come back and choose another option.<br>
            3.  People don’t care how things work they just want their work to be done.<br>

            <h1><u>Chapter 3</u> "Billboard Design 101"</h1><br>

            We know people scan the pages so design your website in such a way so that they can get a lot of your site while scanning.<br>
            1.  The appearance of the things on the page should be clear.Important things and the relationships between the things should be highlighted properly.A good visual hierarchy helps to prioritize important things and grasp most the things instantly.<br>
            2.  Conventions help users to find the area of interest so it plays an important role for them.<br>
            3.  Breaking up pages into defined areas help the users to identify the important areas where they actually have to concentrate and can ignore other areas.<br>
            4.  Make the links and buttons in such a way so that it is understandable for users what are clickable and what is not.<br>
            5.  Don’t make the pages too messy. It will lead to confusing users and difficulty for finding their interests.<br>

            <h1><u>Chapter 4</u> "Animal, vegetable or Mineral?"</h1><br>

                Designers have discussed a lot about how many numbers of clicks should be there to reach anywhere.We have many design rules regarding these things.But the point is a number of clicks don't matter much but the effort and the number of thoughts required for every click matters a lot. So a number of clicks are ok but every click should be very easy for the user. <br>
                We always come across options at most of the steps such as in while installing Microsoft 
                Users always stuck at that point what to choose maybe one wrong choice leads spoil all the effort. So make the choices more easy to understand and familiar so that it will be a mindless action for them.

             <h1><u>Chapter 5</u> "Omit Needless Words"</h1><br>
                Removing useless things is very important for the website.As nobody is going to read those things so removing it doesn’t minimize the page value. A lot of useless things just fills the page unnecessarily and make difficult for users to find their goals.It has several beneficial effects:<br>

                1.  It will minimize the noise.<br>
                2.  It helps to highlight more important things.<br>
                3.  Then a page will consume less space and user will get chance to look more without scrolling.<br>
                We should avoid more of happy talks as users are not interested and even don’t have time for happy talks.Welcoming them to site and thanking them is all waste as users don’t care about these things.So removing these type talks is a good option.<br>

                We should also minimize instructions. If the site is self-explanatory then there is less need for instructions.Most of the users don’t read the instructions.

            <h1><u>Chapter 6</u> "Street Signs and Breadcrumbs"</h1><br>
              Giving directions and sings is very important for users.Users should be able to find the way to his goal. Different users have different approaches some will look for search bar or some will choose to browse.<br>
              1.  If you choose to browse signs will guide you to reach your destination and if don’t get appropriate signs to understand you will be frustrated and leave.<br>
              2.  If you choose to browse these things the user has to face:-<br>
              •  No sense of scale-how much we have to explore, where we have to stop searching.Maybe in a first look, we will find the destinations or after a number of trials.<br>
              • No sense of direction-In website user faces difficulties while to decide in which direction they should look for their work.<br>
              • No sense of location-Sometimes to reach some places there are shortcuts but if the user doesn't know it will take a lot of time for them to reach the same place.<br>
              While using website web navigation plays a crucial role to guide users how to use the site.Some signs or indications should be always there on every page for users so that they know where are they and if they want to come back or want to go to another page they should be able to do that.<br>

              Breadcrumbs are also a good way to show what is the current location of the user.And tabs are very easy to use in case of switching from one page to another.<br>

              Search:- Most used components whenever the user enters a site he looks for search if the site has some uncatchy word doing the same thing user won't be comfortable to use that. 
              Giving search facility should be very flexible for them. Having different options for search and criteria will make user little confused.

                <h1><u>Chapter 7</u>"Designing the Home Page"</h1><br>
               Making the homepage is the biggest challenge as we have to accomodate all the things which a website offers.
               Site identification:-Home page always has to tell which site it is and what it's for and why it is better than another site.
                <br>
               1.  Site purpose:- An overview of what it offers. How and what user can find on this site.<br> 
               2.  Search:- Every user search for a search box the moment they come to the site.<br>
               3.  Advertisements-Good deals and feature promos are also supported website to grow well.<br>
               4.  Registration:-website needs to have registration facility to keep good care of their users<br>
               5.  Direction to proceed:- Users should get an idea where they have to start to reach their goals.<br> 
               6.  Trust:- The Home page is the first and last impression so make it in such a way user should be happy.Use good taglines to catch the attention of users.Purpose and direction to start are main things to focus.<br>

              Different people have different opinions on how they want a website to be.Designers think people like sites which are visually interesting on the other hand developers think the site should have cool features and senior management want the site to be appealing with respect to marketing purpose.These differences lead to conflict.We should take care of average users what they want, we can't make everyone happy but we can try for the majority.

              <h1><u>Chapter 9</u> "Usability Testing"</h1><br>
              After making website main thing is to have usability tests and focus group test. It helps to get a clear idea that how much we are close to success.<br>
              1.  Usability Tests---In this a sample or prototype is given to the user to identify that user is able to understand what is the website, what it offers and is he able to search for his interests.
              2.  Focus group:- It is a group activity.People with different opinions sit together and discuss what they need from the website. <br>
              Testing is very important, do not test is much better than testing with one user.That will give you a clear idea where your site lacks.How users are reacting while using your site for the first time.

                While user using the website they have a certain amount of goodwill level which goes on increasing and decreasing time to time.But Sometimes we can control their goodwill level because it will help the user to stay for longer and get satisfaction from our website.<br>
                1.  Help them in such a way that they can be more clear about their interests and way to find the goal.
                2.  The website should be upfront so that user can develop some interests instantly by seeing them.
                3.  They shouldn’t get bored.Know the faqs that user can have so it will help them.
                4.  Make it easy for them to recover their errors otherwise, they will be frustrated.
                5.   In some situations, if you can't do anything apologies for it.

              The website we design should have the capability so that all the people can use it.As we know we have 65% of the population with the disability so these should also be able to use our website. <br>
              This thing just increases the work of designers and developers.For people with disabilty, css plays a crucial role.<br>
              1.  Allow your text to resize.<br>
              2.  Serialize your content.<br>
              3.  Make forms in such way that are easy for screen readers.<br>
              4.  Use client-side maps.<br>

              How much personal information is ok according to users.For marketing purpose, it is beneficial for us but users are a little bit worried while giving their full information. So we have to keep in mind how much information is required during the registration process. The more you ask the more they lie to you and will lose the trust and it makes you look bad. <br>
